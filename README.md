<h1>Project and readme file is a work in progress</h1>

This is a personal project that I worked on / have been working on in summer 2023. It is meant to act as practice and showcase the skills in C#/.NET that I learned in the summer of 2023. This is project is a Jeopardy game made with WPF. It uses XAML and C#. 

<h3>Features:</h3>
