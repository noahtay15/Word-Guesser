This is a personal project that I worked on in the summer of 2023. It is meant to act as practice and showcase the skills in C#/.NET that I learned in the summer of 2023. This project is a Jeopardy game made with WPF. It uses XAML and C#. 
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a working product, but not a finished product. See TODO.txt to see some of the things I plan on working on. Think of it as a product at the end of sprint one. It's not super polished with things such as input validation, and UI design, but I don't have time to work on it since I have an internship and my capstone project this semester.</p>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allows for 1 to 4 players. Some aspects of the game change dynamically based on the number of players.</li>
  <li>Allows users to select their name and theme color, allowing for a little bit of customization.</li>
  <li>Reads from txt files containing the question hints and answers. Questions are randomly selected, so not every game is the same. This allows for a limited amount of replayability.</li>
  <li>Each player is allowed one guess for each question. All players that get the answer are awarded the 100 points.</li>
</ul>
