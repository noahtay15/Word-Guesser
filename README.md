<h1>Project and readme file is a work in progress</h1>

This is a personal project that I worked on / have been working on in the summer of 2023. It is meant to act as practice and showcase the skills in C#/.NET that I learned in the summer of 2023. This project is a Jeopardy game made with WPF. It uses XAML and C#. 

<h3>Features:</h3>

  <li>Allows for 1 to 4 players. Some aspects of the game change dynamically based on the number of players.</li>
  <li>Allows users to select their name and theme color.</li>
  <li>Reads from txt files containing the question hints and answers. Questions are randomly selected, so not every game is the same.</li>
