General:
- Put this in a GitHub repository
- Figure out how to get VS to connect to the GitHub repository


MainWindow:
- Get rid of the bar up top

Player:
-May have more but idk

PlayerInitBox:
- Pretty much all of it
- Position of the box(es) will be dependent on how many there are, therefore there will be an overloaded method to set that up
- Constructor will have parameters 
	- title: "Player _ choose your name and color"

PlayerNumberScreen:

PlayersInitScreen:
- Do PlayerInitBox class
	- Finish constructor after
- For some reason, init boxes do now show
	- not sure if because it is not getting the player number from PlayerNumberScreen, or i have to make it visible?? 

QuestionsScreen:
-All of it

TitleScreen:
-May come back after completing everything and touch up the xaml

WinnerScreen:
-All of it
